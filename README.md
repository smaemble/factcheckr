Sentiment Analysis involves discerning opinions expressed in various texts, categorizing them into different polarities such as positive, negative, or neutral. Also referred to as opinion mining and polarity detection. This process enables the identification of the underlying sentiment within documents, websites, social media feeds, political speeches, reviews and more. Sentiment Analysis is a form of classification, organizing data into distinct classes.
