SA is a cover term for approaches which extract information on emotion or opinion from natural language (Silge and Robinson 2017). SA have been successfully applied to analysis of language data in a wide range of disciplines such as psychology, economics, education, as well as political and social sciences. Commonly SA are used to determine the stance of a larger group of speakers towards a given phenomenon such as political candidates or parties, product lines or situations. Crucially, SA are employed in these domains because they have advantages compared to alternative methods investigating the verbal expression of emotion. One advantage of SA is that the emotion coding of SA is fully replicable.
